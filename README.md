# The AAA algorithm for rational approximation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/c-f-h/aaa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/c-f-h/aaa)

## NOTE: This library is no longer maintained, and the AAA implementation has been subsumed into the more general ``baryrat`` package! Please follow the link: https://github.com/c-f-h/baryrat

This is a Python implementation of the AAA algorithm for rational approximation
described in the paper "The AAA Algorithm for Rational Approximation" by Yuji
Nakatsukasa, Olivier SÃ¨te, and Lloyd N. Trefethen, SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing 2018 40:3, A1494-A1522.
[(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1106122)

A MATLAB implementation of this algorithm is contained in [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/).
The present Python version is a more or less direct port of the MATLAB version.

The "cleanup" feature for spurious poles and zeros is not currently implemented.

## Installation

The implementation is in pure Python and requires only numpy and scipy as
dependencies. Install it using pip:

    pip install aaa-approx

## Usage

Here's an example of how to approximate a function in the interval [0,1]:

    import numpy as np
    from aaa import aaa

    Z = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 1000)
    F = np.exp(Z) * np.sin(2*np.pi*Z)

    r = aaa(F, Z, mmax=10)

Instead of the maximum number of terms `mmax`, it's also possible to specify
the error tolerance `tol`.  Both arguments work exactly as in the MATLAB
version.

The returned object `r` is an instance of the class `aaa.BarycentricRational` and can
be called like a function. For instance, you can compute the error on `Z` like this:

    err = F - r(Z)
    print(np.linalg.norm(err, np.inf))

If you are interested in the poles and residues of the computed rational function,
you can query them like

    pol,res = r.polres()

and the zeroes using

    zer = r.zeros()

Finally, the nodes, values and weights used for interpolation (called `zj`, `fj`
and `wj` in the original implementation) can be accessed as properties:

    r.nodes
    r.values
    r.weights
